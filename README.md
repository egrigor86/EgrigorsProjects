This repository is a personal collection of small, useful programs Iâ€™ve created to improve my workflow, save time, and eliminate repetitive tasks. Each tool in here is built with simplicity, speed, and real-world use in mind. If you find them useful too â€” awesome. If not, well, they make my life easier.

This is my stash of "why hasn't anyone made this already?" scripts.

ðŸ“Œ Included Tools (so far)

ðŸ”¹ Python Venv Creator GUI A lightweight tkinter GUI for quickly creating virtual environments from detected Python installs. Features:

Scans only C:/ root-level folders (like C:/Python310) for python.exe.

Lets you choose which Python interpreter to use.

Allows you to pick a folder to install the venv directly into â€” no subfolders.

Automatically creates a start.bat file in that folder to activate the environment instantly via Command Prompt.

Perfect for spinning up new isolated workspaces in seconds.
