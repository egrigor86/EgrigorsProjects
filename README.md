This repository is a personal collection of small, useful programs Iâ€™ve created to improve my workflow, save time, and eliminate repetitive tasks. Each tool in here is built with simplicity, speed, and real-world use in mind. If you find them useful too â€” awesome. If not, well, they make my life easier.

This is my stash of "why hasn't anyone made this already?" scripts.
